# Socio-Economic Factors and GDP Per Capita Analysis in Indian States (2017-2019)

## Problem Statement
This project investigates the impact of various socio-economic factors on GDP per capita across 30 states in India from 2017 to 2019. The aim is to understand the relationships between these factors and GDP per capita, which can inform targeted policy interventions to foster economic growth, reduce unemployment, and alleviate poverty.

## Research Questions
1. How does natural population growth rate correlate with GDP per capita?
2. What is the impact of public expenditure on health on GDP per capita?
3. Is there a correlation between relief expenditure on natural calamities and GDP per capita?
4. How does total food grains production influence GDP per capita?

## Plan
Data was sourced from the Reserve Bank of India's official website. Predictor variables include natural population growth rate, public expenditure on health, relief expenditure on natural calamities, total food grains production, state-wise invested capital, and unemployment rates. The response variable is GDP per capita. Statistical models, including multiple regression analysis, were used to quantify the relationships.

## Data
- Data collected from the Reserve Bank of India's official website.
- Variables include predictor variables and response variable (GDP per capita).
- Preprocessing steps included removing Union territories, imputing missing values, and testing variables for normality.

## Analysis
- Descriptive statistics and statistical inference were conducted.
- Parametric and non-parametric tests were performed to assess the significance of relationships.
- Linear regression models were built to predict GDP per capita.

## Results
- Insights were gained into the relationships between socio-economic factors and GDP per capita.
- Regional variations between northern and southern states were observed.
- Predictive models demonstrated promising performance.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the nuanced impact of socio-economic factors on GDP per capita in Indian states. Future steps could involve expanding the dataset to include more recent years and additional socioeconomic variables, as well as exploring advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for deeper insights.
